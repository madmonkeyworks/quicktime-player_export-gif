# DESCRIPTION
Little nifty feature for Quicktime Player that lets you export gif from current playback position and of a certain duration. 
Uses applescript and ffmpeg. Export options are customizable.

# REQUIREMENTS 
works only for OS X / macOS with the following installed:
- Quicktime Player 
- Terminal 
- ffmpeg 

# SETUP
- download file "script.scpt" from this repository and place it in the following folder 
"/Users/*your username*/Library/Scripts/Applications/Quicktime Player"

- make sure you have ffmpeg installed. 
If not, the simplest way is using homebrew in Terminal (brew install ffmpeg). Or google "install ffmpeg"

# FFMPEG CONFIGURATION
The script summons all variables and sends it to ffmpeg as follows:
ffmpeg -ss $start -t $duration -i $inputFile -vf "fps=$fps, scale=$scale:flags=lanczos" -loop 0 $outputFile
